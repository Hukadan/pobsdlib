### pobsdlib
Library in Rust to read the PlayOnBSD database 
(https://github.com/playonbsd/OpenBSD-Games-Database.)


### How to use it
At the moment you have to edit the file `src/bin/export_json.rs` and change 
the path of the database to yours, then run `cargo run`.

I plan to improve this soon(ish).
